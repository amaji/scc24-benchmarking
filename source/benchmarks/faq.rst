Frequently asked questions
----------------------------------

  - **When should we inform the SCC committee about code modifications to the benchmark source codes?**
  
    If you modify the source codes for any of the benchmark applications, such modifications should be communicated to the SCC24 committee by Nov 13, 2024 (Wed). This is to make sure that the committee has sufficient time to review and approve the changes. Code modifications after this date *may* be allowed by the SCC committee only in exceptional circumstances.

  - **We have novel hardware for which X benchmark has not been optimized. How can we still be competitive with other teams?**

    Your raw benchmark output constitutes a fraction of your benchmarking score. You will also be evaluated on your performance during the interview, your overall methodology, and your contributions to the community. The benchmarking judges will make every effort to perform fair comparisons across different hardware.

  - **Our team optimized the code for X. Do we get extra credit for that?**

    If your team made *significant code contribution* to any benchmark or application, which is *validated* by the respective judges and *shared publicly* with the community *before the start of the competition*, then the judges can award bonus points to the team for that application or benchmark. Note that the awarding of bonus points will be at the discretion of the judge(s) and may not exceed 10% of the total score for that benchmark or application.

    To receive bonus points for MLPerf-SDXL Inference benchmark, teams must 1) publicly share their code changes with the community by creating a pull request to one or more of the following repositories: ``mlcommons/cm4mlops``, ``mlcommons/inference``, ``mlcommons/inference_results_v4.0``, at least 48 hours before the start of the competition (Nov 16, 2024, 9:00AM EDT), 2) have their code changes reviewed by the MLCommons reviewer(s), 3) accept the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to merge the PR into the repository.
