Benchmarking interview and grading
----------------------------------
This year, the benchmark judges will interview each SCC24 team between 1:00 PM EDT and 4:00 PM EDT on Nov 18, 2024 and ask them questions about their cluster configurations and the benchmarks. The objective of the interview is to get a comprehensive overview of the clusters and understand each team's tuning methodology.

The overall benchmarking score for a team will depend on multiple factors such as the output obtained for each benchmark, the benchmarking interview, and the team's adherence to the rules set by the SCC committee. The benchmarks (HPL, MLPerf-SDXL, and  the mystery benchmark) will carry equal weights towards the final benchmarking score.
